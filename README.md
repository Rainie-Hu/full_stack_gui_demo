# full_stack_gui_demo
### For this project, we are going to build an app using Python Tkinter to gather household information from users and interacte with the backend MySQL database. Everyone in the world can submit their household information and browse the report generated from the database.
### 
### For adding household information, we are requiring the user to includes household basic info (such as: square footage of the household, household type, thermostat setting for heating/cooling, etc.) and appliance info (such as: manufacturer, model name based on different appliance type). After several pages to gather and validate the data, user can submit the data which will be updated in the MySQL database.

### If user request some reports: top manufacturer name with appliance number or search model/manufacturer name. User can use report link to query the data from the database and the result will show in the specifc GUI pages.
